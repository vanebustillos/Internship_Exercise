# Repositories Excercise
This project has been developed to simulate the process of  retrieve data from a DATA file of users in order to show the stored user information such as Name, Nickname, Avatar and GitHub page into proper components. The application was implemented with VueJS framework and Vuetify for design and implement interfaces. 

In order to test the funcionability of the project, Mocha test framework and Chai assertion library were used to make asynchronous testing easier.
